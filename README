Visual time for xmobar/xmonad
-----------------------------

I've found that having a visual cue that time passes helps my focus. This small
app is an attempt to get this. It produces progress bars showing how far in the
day/workday/workweek/whatever it's configured to show.

There's also a rolling calendar view showing upcoming events in a 60 day window.
Hopefully I'll be able to integrate this with google calendar soon^tm.

Example usage:

Add a line to xmobar.hs:
    xmproc2 <- spawnPipe "/usr/bin/xmobar ~/.xmobarrc2"
Create a line in the commands section of ~/.xmobarrc2:
    , Run Com "/usr/bin/python" ["/path/to/visualtime.py"] "visualtime" 1000
Add %visualtime% to the template in .xmobarrc2
Restart xmonad

Screenshot (60 day view abbreviated):
+60d: [¤ .             ] day: [¤¤¤   .     .     .     ] wd: [¤  .    ] ww: [¤¤¤¤ ]
